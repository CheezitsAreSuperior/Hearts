# Hearts

## What is Hearts
  Hearts is an HDL that has very simple syntax and semantics, and also is easy to program in. It is also inspired by Spade, as in the name everything else was not inspired by Spade.

## Reasons
  1. I feel like there should be more HDLs then what we have that I know of.
  2. I just want to have my own HDL.

## Plans
  * For Hearts to become used by some others.
  * Me to extensify my knowledege a lot more.
  * For Hearts to make users more productive.
  * For Hearts to make hardware description a lot easier for users of it.
